Develop a simple data link layer that performs the flow control using the Go Back N
protocol in c
AIM:
Program:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int windowsize,sent=0,ack,i;
printf("enter window size\n");
scanf("%d",&windowsize);
while(1)
{
for( i = 0; i<windowsize; i++)
{
printf("Frame %d has been transmitted.\n",sent);
sent++;
if(sent == windowsize)
break;
}
printf("\nPlease enter the last Acknowledgement received.\n");
scanf("%d",&ack);
if(ack == windowsize)
break;
}
return 0;
}
else
sent = ack;
Output:
enter window size
